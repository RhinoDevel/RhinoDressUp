# RhinoDressUp
Pure JavaScript game without any dependencies (no libraries used), where you dress up Manni the rhinoceros every way you want!

This works completely offline, just copy all the files to some folder on your device and open `index.html`.

Very easily extendable to let you dress something else than a rhino (princess..?).
